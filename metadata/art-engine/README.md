# Assets | Coinbae Art Engine 🪙

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/jm-nft-testing/coinbae_header.png)

This art engine is used to create generative image art and metadata from pre-made artwork layers. It is based off of the Hashlips Art Engine. Read more about the amazing Hashlips Art Engine [here](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine).

## Sample Base URI

`NonFungibleCoinbae` on IPFS: [`https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYnznvRMX7NYeGg87D51ruzmuuq2schCMde5ch3Pz3j3S`](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYnznvRMX7NYeGg87D51ruzmuuq2schCMde5ch3Pz3j3S)

## Getting Started

1. Have your Pinata account with a Secret Key and API Key (to upload assets to IPFS and pin them via Pinata)
2. Place your artwork layers in the corresponding directories in the `assets/layers` folder following the guidelines below
3. Configure the `config.js` file to match the traits and details of your collection

## Uploading Assets and Retrieving IPFS Hash

1. Install Dependencies

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

1. Initialize Images and Metadata

   ```
   yarn initialize
   ```

1. Upload Images to Pinata

   ```
   yarn upload
   ```

1. Update Metadata files with Uploaded Images

   ```
   yarn update
   ```

1. Upload Metadata files to IPFS

   ```
   yarn upload:metadata
   ```

1. Copy Pinata Gateway link from `/build/URI/postRevealMetadataURL.txt` and set as base URI in contract

## Usage ℹ️

Create your different layers as folders in the 'layers' directory, and add all the layer assets in these directories. You can name the assets anything as long as it has a rarity weight attached in the file name like so: `example element#70.png`. You can optionally change the delimiter `#` to anything you would like to use in the variable `rarityDelimiter` in the `src/config.js` file.

Once you have all your layers, go into `src/config.js` and update the `layerConfigurations` objects `layersOrder` array to be your layer folders name in order of the back layer to the front layer.

_Example:_ If you were creating a portrait design, you might have a background, then a head, a mouth, eyes, eyewear, and then headwear, so your `layersOrder` would look something like this:

```js
const layerConfigurations = [
  {
    growEditionSizeTo: 100,
    layersOrder: [
      { name: "Head" },
      { name: "Mouth" },
      { name: "Eyes" },
      { name: "Eyeswear" },
      { name: "Headwear" },
    ],
  },
];
```

The `name` of each layer object retokenIndicessents the name of the folder (in `/layers/`) that the images reside in.

Optionally you can now add multiple different `layerConfigurations` to your collection. Each configuration can be unique and have different layer orders, use the same layers or introduce new ones. This gives the artist flexibility when it comes to fine tuning their collections to their needs.

_Example:_ If you were creating a portrait design, you might have a background, then a head, a mouth, eyes, eyewear, and then headwear and you want to create a new race or just simple re-order the layers or even introduce new layers, then you're `layerConfigurations` and `layersOrder` would look something like this:

```js
const layerConfigurations = [
  {
    // Creates up to 50 artworks
    growEditionSizeTo: 50,
    layersOrder: [
      { name: "Background" },
      { name: "Head" },
      { name: "Mouth" },
      { name: "Eyes" },
      { name: "Eyeswear" },
      { name: "Headwear" },
    ],
  },
  {
    // Creates an additional 100 artworks
    growEditionSizeTo: 150,
    layersOrder: [
      { name: "Background" },
      { name: "Head" },
      { name: "Eyes" },
      { name: "Mouth" },
      { name: "Eyeswear" },
      { name: "Headwear" },
      { name: "AlienHeadwear" },
    ],
  },
];
```

Update your `format` size, ie the outputted image size, and the `growEditionSizeTo` on each `layerConfigurations` object, which is the amount of variation outputted.

You can mix up the `layerConfigurations` order on how the images are saved by setting the variable `shuffleLayerConfigurations` in the `config.js` file to true. It is false by default and will save all images in numerical order.

If you want to have logs to debug and see what is happening when you generate images you can set the variable `debugLogs` in the `config.js` file to true. It is false by default, so you will only see general logs.

If you need a layers to have a different opacity then you can add the `opacity: 0.7` field to the layersOrder `options` object as well.

If you want to have a layer _ignored_ in the DNA uniqueness check, you can set `bypassDNA: true` in the `options` object. This has the effect of making sure the rest of the traits are unique while not considering the `Background` Layers as traits, for example. The layers _are_ included in the final image.

The program will output all the images in the `build/images` directory along with the metadata files in the `build/json` directory. Each collection will have a `_metadata.json` file that consists of all the metadata in the collection inside the `build/json` directory. The `build/json` folder also will contain all the single json files that retokenIndicessent each image file. The single json file of a image will look something like this:

```json
{
  "dna": "d956cdf4e460508b5ff90c21974124f68d6edc34",
  "name": "#1",
  "description": "This is the description of your NFT project",
  "image": "https://hashlips/nft/1.png",
  "edition": 1,
  "date": 1731990799975,
  "attributes": [
    { "trait_type": "Background", "value": "Black" },
    { "trait_type": "Eyeball", "value": "Red" },
    { "trait_type": "Eye color", "value": "Yellow" },
    { "trait_type": "Iris", "value": "Small" },
    { "trait_type": "Shine", "value": "Shapes" },
    { "trait_type": "Bottom lid", "value": "Low" },
    { "trait_type": "Top lid", "value": "Middle" }
  ],
  "compiler": "HashLips Art Engine"
}
```

You can also add extra metadata to each metadata file by adding your extra items, (key: value) pairs to the `extraMetadata` object variable in the `config.js` file.

```js
const extraMetadata = {
  creator: "Daniel Eugene Botha",
};
```

If you don't need extra metadata, simply leave the object empty. It is empty by default.

```js
const extraMetadata = {};
```

That's it, you're done.
